Talk on my work on photons resulting from the passage of high energy partons through a Quark-Gluon Plasma. These can be classified in two categories:

- bremsstrahlung photons which are radiated by the hard quarks or anti-quarks. These are due to the exchange of soft gluons with the medium. The hard parton acquires virtuality from these soft, elastic scatterings which it radiates in the form of a bremsstrahlung gluon or photon.
- conversion photons, where by in the limit of exchanging an ultra soft fermion with the medium, assuming there is little to no energy loss in the process, we can consuder the hard parton to have ``converted'' to a photon.

My presentation earned my a 2nd place finish in the Division of Nuclear Physics as well as the conference-wide Best Student Oral Competition.
