## About Me

I am a recent Ph.D. graduate from McGill University in theoretical high-energy nuclear physics. I am interested in particle & nuclear physics, computer science, mathematics and, more recently, data science and machine learning. In my spare time, I like to fiddle with new programming languages or machine learning projects, check out some Leet Code problems, read fiction and watch movies.

## Research

For my doctoral research, I focused on the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), a state of matter created by high energy collision of heavy ions at major experimental facilities like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, CERN, Switzerland) or the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC, Brookhaven National Lab, NY, USA). I was interested in the production and passage of hard (meaning high energy or high transverse momentum) partons[^1], which are created at the moment of collision and encounter a QGP medium as they leave the interaction point. The hard parton and the surrounding medium can interact via the strong nuclear force, interactions which are described by Quantum Chromodynamics or QCD. Through these interactions, the hard parton loses energy to the medium. Our way of studying these modifications and the energy loss is to compare the results of heavy ion collisions (charged hadron[^2] & jet spectra, photon spectra, jet substructure etc.) to those from a proton-proton collision at the same energy, we can learn quite a bit about the many-body physics aspects of QCD, as well as our models of jet-medium[^3] interactions. I was supported by the [Tomlinson Doctoral Fellowship](https://www.mcgill.ca/gps/tomlinson) for the first three years. I also received partial funding as a teaching assistant. You can find my Ph.D. thesis [here](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/f1881s60t). I believe for the second half of my Ph.D., my stipend was paid from my supervisor's NSERC grant but I am not sure. I will ask him and update here.

The above research work involved a lot of computation on the computing clusters of The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (formerly Compute Canada). Thus, I gained experience in using the Slurm scheduler, for staging and managing my Monte Carlo simulations. â€‹In addition, I also gained programming experience in C++, Python and Bash by developing and debugging our research code base.

My Master's project was concerned with _exotic hadrons_. In the early 2000s, the LHC came online and there was the unexpected discovery of interesting hadrons such as $$D_{s}(2317)$$ or $$X(3872)$$. These particles seemed to defy expectations from quark model calculations. I was interested in looking at a relatively simple extension to the quark model that would allow the model to account for all or some of these states. The idea was motivated by the observation that some of these newly detected particles were quite close (and slightly below) various decay channels. Thus, it was hypothesized that they were receiving corrections to their masses due to proximity to these decay channels. During the course of the research, the project morphed into a study of the model itself rather than the exotic hadrons. I found that the fundamental assumptions in the model were not valid. I was funded, in the 1st year of my graduate studies, by the general funding package at Carleton, which included TA work. In the 2nd year of Masters, I was funded by the Master's Program of Canada Graduate Scholarships, provided by the National Science and Engineering Research Council.

[^1]: _Parton_ is a generic term for a quark, anti-quark or gluon. It referes to particles that are _part_ of a composite particle.
[^2]: Hadrons are composite particles, made from a combination of quarks, anti-quarks and gluons. Typically, a hadron with a quark and anti-quark pair is called a _meson_ while a particle with three quarks (or three anti-quarks) is called a _brayon_. An example of the latter is the proton.
[^3]: _Jet_ refers to an individual hard parton as well as a collimated spray of hadrons travelling in the same direction.
