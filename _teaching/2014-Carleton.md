Starting 2014, I was the teaching assistant (at different times, different semesters) for

- PHYS 1007/1008: Elementary University Physics I & II, the laboratory section
- PHYS 3701: Elements of Quantum Mechanics
- PHYS 4602: Physics of Elementary Particles
- PHYS 4608: Nuclear Physics

During this time, depending on the course, I held office hours, helped students in need of more targeted guidance, graded assignments and lab reports and proctored exams.
