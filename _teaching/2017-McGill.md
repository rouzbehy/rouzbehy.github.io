From Fall 2017 to Winter 2020, during different semesters I was the teaching assistant for

- PHYS 230: Dynamics of Simple Systems
- PHYS 346: Majors Quantum Mechanics
- PHYS 567: Particle Physics

I organized tutorial sessions and led discussion of the course material for undergraduate students as well as offering office hours and one-on-one help. Provided feedback to students and proctored exams.
