Energetic partons traveling in a strongly interacting medium lose energy by emitting radiation and through collisions with medium constituents. Nonperturbative, next-to-leading-order and leading-order collision kernels are implemented within AMY-McGill formalism. The resulting gluon emission rates are then evaluated and compared by considering scattering occurring in a brick of quark-gluon plasma, as well as in a realistic simulation of Pb+Pb collisions at $$\sqrt{s}=2.76$$ ATeV using martini. We find that the variations in quenching of hard partons resulting from using different kernels can be important, depending on the overall value of the strong-coupling constant, $$\alpha_s$$.
